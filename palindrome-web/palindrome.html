        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Palindromes are words or sentences that have the same spelling from their first alphabet to their last alphabet and from their last alphabet to their first alphabet, even if that's only after removal of punctuation marks or spaces.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="testing-section">
        <h2>Direction for Testing</h2>
        <p>Separate entries (phrases or sentences) to be tested as a single palindrome by pressing the `Enter key` once at least. Irrespective, all individual words in all the lines would be tested whether they are palindromes or not in addition to the tested Phrases or Sentences that are on each new line.</p>
        <p>Do note that single alphabet words are not taken as palindromes, and that multiple palindrome words or phrases in the inputs would only be shown to have passed as palindromes once.</p>
